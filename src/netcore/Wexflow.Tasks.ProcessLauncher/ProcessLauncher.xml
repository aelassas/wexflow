    ProcessLauncher is a sequential task that launches a process. If this process generates a file as output
    It is possible to pass a collection of files to the task so that for each file an output
    file will be generated through the process.
    
    The files generated are loaded in this task so that other tasks can select them through 
    the selectFiles option.
    
    This task is useful for transforming images or transcoding video and audio files.

  <Task id="$int" name="ProcessLauncher" description="$string" enabled="true|false">
    <!-- 
      The files loaded by the task having as id $taskId will be
      passed to the process command.
    -->
    <Setting name="selectFiles" value="$taskId" />
    <Setting name="selectFiles" value="$taskId" />
    <!-- You can add as many selecteFiles as you want.-->
    <!-- The process path. Example: C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC\vlc.exe-->
    <Setting name="processPath" value="$string" />
    <!-- The process command.
         It is possible to lauch a process that does not generates files. In this case the generatesFiles option must be false.
         If this process generates a file as output, it is possible to pass the input file to
         the process commad through {$filePath} variable. The output file path can be set through the {$output} variable
         which is defined as follows: {$output:$fileNameWithoutExtension|$fileName[a-zA-Z0-9._-]*}
         If this process generates files as output, for each file loaded the process will be launxhed and
         the {$filePath} variable will be replaced by the file path of the loaded file and the {$output:$fileNameWithoutExtension|$fileName[a-zA-Z0-9._-]*}
         will be replaced by $JobTempFolder\$fileNameWithoutExtension|$fileName[a-zA-Z0-9._-]* where $JobTempFolder is the temp folder of the job.
         Each file generated will be loaded in this task so that other tasks can select it through the selectFiles option.
         Example: -I dummy {$filePath} :sout=#transcode{acodec=mpga}:std{dst={$output:$fileNameWithoutExtension.mp3},access=file} vlc://quit-->
