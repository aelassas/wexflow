    Approval is a sequential task that marks the current workflow as needing approval.
    
    To use this task the workflow must be an approval workflow. This can be done whether from the designer 
    page in the back end or by editing the XML of the workflow.
    
    If the workflow is rejected the OnRejected workflow event is raised and the tasks after Approval
    task are not executed.
    
    The disapproval of workflows can be done by clicking on reject button whether from Approval page in the back end
    or from Wexflow Manager.
