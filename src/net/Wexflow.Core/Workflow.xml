    This is the configuration file of a workflow. 
    A workflow is composed of:
      - An id which is an integer that must be unique.
      - A name which is a string that must be unique.
      - A description which is a string.
      - A Settings section which is composed of the following elements:
        - A launchType which is one of the following options:
          - startup: The workflow is launched when Wexflow Engine starts.
          - trigger: The workflow is launched manually from Wexflow Manager.
          - periodic: The workflow is launched periodically.
          - cron: The workflow is launched depending on a cron expression.
        - A period which is necessary for the periodic launchType. It is 
          a timeSpan in this format dd.hh:mm:ss. For example the period
          00.00:02:00 will launch the workflow every 2 minutes.
        - A cron expression which is necessary for the cron launchType.
          For example '0 0/2 * * * ?' will launch the workflow every 2 minutes.
        - The enabled option which allows to enable or disable a workflow.
          The possible values are true or false.
        - The approval option which marks the current workflow as an approval workflow.
          The possible values are true or false. An approval workflow must contain
          at least one Approval task or more.
        - The enableParallelJobs option Shows whether workflow jobs are executed in parallel. 
          Otherwise jobs are queued. Defaults to true.
        - The retryCount option allows to retry a task a certain number of times in case of
          failure. Defaults to 0 (no retry).
        - The retryTimeout option indicates the waiting time between two tries in milliseconds.
          Defaults to 1500ms.
      - A LocalVariables section which contains local variables.
      - A Tasks section which contains the tasks that will be executed by
        the workflow one after the other.
        - A Task is composed of:
          - An id which is an integer that must be unique.
          - A name which is one of the options described in the tasks documentation.
          - A description which is a string.
          - The enabled option which allows to enable or disable a task. The possible 
            values are true or false.
          - A collection of settings.
      - An ExecutionGraph section which contains the execution graph of the workflow.
