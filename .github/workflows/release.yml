# ==============================================================
#  GitHub Actions Workflow — Release
# --------------------------------------------------------------
#  Purpose:
#    This workflow provides a unified "release" badge
#    that reflects the combined status of the following workflows:
#      - docker-hub.yml       → Publishes the docker-hub manifest
#      - bump-version.yml → Bumps version
#
#  Behavior:
#    • Automatically runs after any of the above workflows complete.
#    • Checks their latest runs.
#    • Fails if any of them failed, were skipped, or did not run.
#    • Can also be triggered manually from the GitHub Actions tab.
#
#  Badge:
#    ![release](https://github.com/aelassas/servy/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)
#
#  Result:
#    Green  → All release workflows succeeded
#    Red    → One or more failed or skipped
